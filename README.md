**Predictive Maintenance For Machine Failure**

This project aims to develop a predictive maintenance model using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) that can accurately classify failure types and predict the occurrence of a failure in a binary format. The model uses five features, namely air temperature, process temperature, rotational speed, torque, and tool wear to predict the target features.

The first target feature is Failure Type, which is a multi-class classification problem. The model is trained to classify different types of failures, such as tool wear, breakage, and surface damage. The model achieves an accuracy of 95% in classifying the failure types, which can be used to identify the type of maintenance required for the system.

The second target feature is the occurrence of failure, which is a binary classification problem. The model is trained to predict whether a failure will occur or not, based on the input features. The model achieves an accuracy of 95% in predicting the occurrence of failure, which can be used to schedule maintenance activities before the system breaks down.

The model uses an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to make predictions, which is a powerful machine learning algorithm capable of handling non-linear relationships between input features and target variables. The ANN is trained using a large dataset of historical data, which enables the model to learn patterns and make accurate predictions.

Overall, this project demonstrates the effectiveness of using an ANN-based approach to develop a predictive maintenance model for industrial systems. The model's high accuracy in predicting failure types and occurrence can help improve system uptime, reduce maintenance costs, and increase overall productivity.
